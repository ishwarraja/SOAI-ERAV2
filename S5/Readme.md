This section of code block 5,6 snippet is related to data loading and visualization in PyTorch using DataLoader and Matplotlib. 

The Net class defines in code block 7 a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture with four convolutional layers, followed by two fully connected layers. The forward method specifies the flow of data through the network, applying ReLU activations and max pooling operations. The network output is transformed using log softmax to obtain the class probabilities.


Overall, block 9 code provides the functionality to train and evaluate a PyTorch model using the provided train and test loaders, optimizer, and criterion. It also calculates and tracks the training and test accuracy and loss during the process.


Block 10 code trains a neural network model (Net) for a specified number of epochs, performs training and evaluation steps using the provided data loaders (train_loader), optimizer, and criterion, and adjusts the learning rate using an optimizer scheduler. The progress of the training process is displayed with information about each epoch.

Block 11 code generates a figure with a 2x2 grid of subplots, each displaying a different metric (training loss, training accuracy, test loss, and test accuracy) using the provided data (train_losses, train_acc, test_losses, and test_acc). The figsize parameter sets the size of the figure.
