### NEURAL NETWORK AND ITS ELABORATION


In bloc 1 by importing these modules, you can access a wide range of functionality and tools needed for building and training neural networks, as well as working with popular datasets and applying data transformations

In block 3 code snippet transformers are commonly used for image data preprocessing in deep learning tasks. The specific operations help introduce variations, standardize sizes, and normalize pixel values to improve the model's performance and generalization


The block 4 code snippet is responsible for loading and preparing the MNIST dataset for training and testing purposes. The datasets.MNIST class from the torchvision library is used to download and load the MNIST dataset. MNIST is a popular dataset consisting of 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9). By executing these two lines, the MNIST training and test sets are downloaded (if necessary) and loaded into the respective variables train_data and test_data. These variables can then be used in further code for training and evaluating machine learning models on the MNIST dataset.


This block 5,6 code snippet is related to data loading and visualization in PyTorch using DataLoader and Matplotlib. 


The Net class defines in code block 7 a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture with four convolutional layers, followed by two fully connected layers. The forward method specifies the flow of data through the network, applying ReLU activations and max pooling operations. The network output is transformed using log softmax to obtain the class probabilities.


Overall, block 9 code provides the functionality to train and evaluate a PyTorch model using the provided train and test loaders, optimizer, and criterion. It also calculates and tracks the training and test accuracy and loss during the process.


Block 10 code trains a neural network model (Net) for a specified number of epochs, performs training and evaluation steps using the provided data loaders (train_loader), optimizer, and criterion, and adjusts the learning rate using an optimizer scheduler. The progress of the training process is displayed with information about each epoch.

Block 11 code generates a figure with a 2x2 grid of subplots, each displaying a different metric (training loss, training accuracy, test loss, and test accuracy) using the provided data (train_losses, train_acc, test_losses, and test_acc). The figsize parameter sets the size of the figure.
